| CREATE | Triggered when a resource (user, client, role, etc.) is created.                 |
| UPDATE | Occurs when a resource is updated.                                               |
| DELETE | FiredFired when a resource is deleted.                                           |

### Keycloak envs

| ENV                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| KC_HTTP_ENABLED          | When set to true, this enables HTTP access to the Keycloak instance. This is useful in development environments but should be used with caution in production, where HTTPS is recommended for security.                                                                      |
| KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT       | Determines whether Keycloak enforces strict hostname validation. Setting this to false means that Keycloak does not enforce hostname validation, which can be useful in development environments or when behind a proxy that manages SSL termination.                        |
| KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT_HTTPS | This specifically controls the strict hostname validation for HTTPS connections. When set to false, it allows more flexibility in accepting different hostnames in SSL/TLS certificates, which is particularly useful during testing or when using self-signed certificates. |
